# FASE 2: Network Scanner Core - Development Sessions

This document tracks the detailed progress of FASE 2 implementation, broken down into 5 development sessions.

**Overall FASE 2 Progress**: 4/5 sessions completed (80%)

---

## Session 1: Port Scanner Foundation ✅ (COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Implement core port scanning with multi-threading

**Status**: Completed

**Duration**: ~45 minutes

### Tasks
- [x] Implement PortScanner.h/cpp class
- [x] Implement ScanWorker.h/cpp class
- [x] Update PortResult.h if needed (not needed)
- [x] Create tests/TestPortScanner.h/cpp
- [x] Test single port scan
- [x] Test port range scan
- [x] Test parallel scanning
- [x] Test timeout handling
- [x] Test cancellation

### Deliverables
- ✅ PortScanner working with thread pool (QThreadPool with configurable thread count)
- ✅ ScanWorker thread-safe implementation (QRunnable with atomic cancellation)
- ✅ Basic unit tests passing (100% - 24 test cases)
- ✅ Progress tracking functional (Qt signals: scanProgress, portFound, scanCompleted)

### Files Created
- ✅ src/core/scanner/PortScanner.h
- ✅ src/core/scanner/PortScanner.cpp
- ✅ src/core/scanner/ScanWorker.h
- ✅ src/core/scanner/ScanWorker.cpp
- ✅ tests/TestPortScanner.h
- ✅ tests/TestPortScanner.cpp

### Implementation Notes
- PortScanner uses QThreadPool for parallel execution (default: 100 threads)
- TCP connect() scan with configurable timeout (default: 2000ms)
- Thread-safe result collection with QMutex
- Atomic operations for state management (isRunning, isCancelled)
- Progress tracking via Qt signals (scanProgress, portFound, scanCompleted)
- Comprehensive test coverage: configuration, validation, scanning, signals, cancellation, state management, thread safety

### Issues Fixed
- Fixed QRunnable/QObject parent conflict (ScanWorker cannot have QObject parent)
- All tests pass (100% success rate)

## Session 2: Service Detection & Network Discovery ✅ (COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Implement service fingerprinting and network utilities

**Status**: Completed

**Duration**: ~1 hour

### Tasks
- [x] Implement ServiceDetector.h/cpp
- [x] Implement DnsResolver.h/cpp
- [x] Implement NetworkInterface.h/cpp
- [x] Update ServiceInfo.h if needed (not needed)
- [x] Create tests/TestServiceDetector.h/cpp
- [x] Create tests/TestDnsResolver.h/cpp
- [x] Create tests/TestNetworkInterface.h/cpp

### Deliverables
- ✅ ServiceDetector with banner grabbing working (HTTP, SSH, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB)
- ✅ DnsResolver functional (sync/async, forward/reverse lookup)
- ✅ NetworkInterface with host discovery (CIDR expansion, IP range support, TCP ping)
- ✅ Unit tests passing (100% - 57 test cases total)

### Files Created
- ✅ src/core/scanner/ServiceDetector.h
- ✅ src/core/scanner/ServiceDetector.cpp
- ✅ src/core/scanner/DnsResolver.h
- ✅ src/core/scanner/DnsResolver.cpp
- ✅ src/core/scanner/NetworkInterface.h

- ✅ tests/TestServiceDetector.h
- ✅ tests/TestServiceDetector.cpp (18 tests)
- ✅ tests/TestDnsResolver.h
- ✅ tests/TestDnsResolver.cpp (20 tests)
- ✅ tests/TestNetworkInterface.h
- ✅ tests/TestNetworkInterface.cpp (19 tests)

### Implementation Notes
- ServiceDetector supports well-known port mapping and banner parsing for major protocols
- DnsResolver uses Qt's QHostInfo with timeout support and async callbacks
- NetworkInterface supports CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) and IP ranges
- Host discovery uses TCP connect on port 80 (configurable)
- All components are thread-safe and emit Qt signals for progress tracking
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and error handling

### Issues Fixed
- Added missing QMap include in DnsResolver.h
- Added missing QDateTime include in NetworkInterface.cpp
- All tests pass (100% success rate)

## Session 3: Scan Engine Orchestrator ✅ (COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Implement central scan orchestration engine

**Status**: Completed

**Duration**: ~1 hour

### Tasks
- [x] Implement ScanEngine.h/cpp
- [x] Create ScanConfiguration class
- [x] Update ScanResult.h (not needed - already complete)
- [x] Create tests/TestScanEngine.h/cpp
- [x] Test full scan workflow
- [x] Test progress reporting
- [x] Test cancellation
- [x] Test error handling

### Deliverables
- ✅ ScanEngine orchestrating complete scans (DNS → Port Scan → Service Detection)
- ✅ Progress tracking accurate (0-100% with status messages)
- ✅ Cancellation working across all components
- ✅ Unit tests passing (100% - 22 test cases)

### Files Created
- ✅ src/core/scanner/ScanEngine.h
- ✅ src/core/scanner/ScanEngine.cpp
- ✅ src/core/scanner/ScanConfiguration.h
- ✅ src/core/scanner/ScanConfiguration.cpp
- ✅ tests/TestScanEngine.h
- ✅ tests/TestScanEngine.cpp (22 tests)

### Implementation Notes
- ScanConfiguration provides preset configurations (quickScan, fullScan, customScan)
- ScanEngine coordinates all scanner components via Qt signals/slots
- Complete workflow: DNS resolution → Port scanning → Service detection
- Progress calculation: 0-10% setup, 10-80% port scan, 80-100% service detection
- Cancellation propagates to PortScanner via stopScan()
- All components integrated: PortScanner, ServiceDetector, DnsResolver, NetworkInterface
- Thread-safe operation with QSharedPointer for component management
- Comprehensive test coverage: configuration validation, scan workflow, signals, error handling

### Issues Fixed
- Adapted to PortScanner API (startScan/stopScan instead of start/cancel)
- Fixed signal connection for scanCompleted (lambda for type conversion)
- Updated PortResult field access (state instead of isOpen, service/version instead of serviceName/serviceVersion)

## Session 4: Repository & CLI Application ✅ (COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Implement database persistence and functional CLI

**Status**: Completed

**Duration**: ~1 hour

### Tasks
- [x] Implement ScanRepository.h/cpp
- [x] Update database schema (already complete)
- [x] Implement CliApplication.h/cpp
- [x] Update CommandLineParser.h/cpp (not needed - created new CliApplication)
- [x] Create tests/TestScanRepository.h/cpp

### Deliverables
- ✅ ScanRepository fully functional (CRUD operations + advanced queries)
- ✅ CLI can perform complete scans
- ✅ CLI can list and view scan history
- ✅ Database persistence working (SQLite with scan + ports tables)
- ✅ Unit tests passing (100% - 20 test cases)

### Files Created
- ✅ src/core/database/ScanRepository.h
- ✅ src/core/database/ScanRepository.cpp
- ✅ src/cli/CliApplication.h
- ✅ src/cli/CliApplication.cpp
- ✅ tests/TestScanRepository.h
- ✅ tests/TestScanRepository.cpp (20 tests)

### Implementation Notes
- ScanRepository implements IRepository<ScanResult> interface with std::optional
- CRUD operations: save, findById, findAll, update, remove
- Advanced queries: findByTarget, findByStatus, findRecent, findByDateRange
- Automatic port results persistence (foreign key relationship)
- Database cleanup: deleteOlderThan method for maintenance
- CliApplication provides full command-line interface
- Commands: scan, list, show, delete, clean
- Integrated with ScanEngine, ScanRepository, and DatabaseManager
- Real-time progress tracking during scans
- Automatic scan saving to database
- Home directory database: ~/.vulnscan/scans.db
- Full command-line argument parsing with QCommandLineParser

### CLI Usage Examples
```bash
vulnscan-cli scan -t 192.168.1.1 -p 1-1000
vulnscan-cli scan -t example.com -p 80-443 -s -d
vulnscan-cli list
vulnscan-cli show -i 42
vulnscan-cli delete -i 42
vulnscan-cli clean --days 7
```

### Issues Fixed
- Adapted ScanRepository to match IRepository interface (void save, std::optional findById, void remove)
- Updated CliApplication to use std::optional for findById
- Updated test cases to work with std::optional return types
