- **Screenshots or logs** if applicable
- **Minimal code example** that demonstrates the issue

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

- **Clear and descriptive title**
- **Detailed description** of the proposed functionality
- **Use case examples** demonstrating why this enhancement would be useful
- **Possible implementation approach** (if you have ideas)

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Follow the coding standards** outlined below
3. **Add tests** for any new functionality
4. **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Write clear commit messages** following our commit conventions
7. **Submit the pull request** with a comprehensive description

## üèóÔ∏è Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VulnScan.git
cd VulnScan

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Build the project
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/qt" ..
cmake --build . -j4

# Run tests
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `test/description` - Test additions or modifications

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions/modifications
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style/formatting changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `build`: Build system changes

**Example:**
```
feat(scanner): add TCP SYN scan support

Implement TCP SYN scanning for faster port detection.
Includes stealth mode and rate limiting options.

Closes #123
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### C++ Style Guide

- **Language**: C++17
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length**: Maximum 100 characters
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., NetworkScanner)
  - Functions/methods: camelCase (e.g., scanPort())
  - Variables: camelCase (e.g., portNumber)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_THREADS)
  - Private members: m_ prefix (e.g., m_database)
  - Interfaces: I prefix (e.g., IScanner)

### Code Organization

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class/function should have one clear purpose
- **Header guards**: Use #pragma once
- **Include order**:
  1. Corresponding header (for .cpp files)
  2. Qt headers
  3. Standard library headers
  4. Third-party library headers
  5. Project headers

### Documentation

- **Doxygen comments** for all public APIs

### Qt Guidelines

- Use **Qt containers** (QVector, QMap, etc.) for Qt-interfacing code
- Use **Qt signals/slots** for event handling
- Prefer **Qt RAII classes** (QScopedPointer, QSharedPointer)
- Make strings **translatable** with tr() for UI text

### Testing

- Write **unit tests** for all new functionality
- Use **Qt Test framework**
- Aim for **high test coverage** (>80%)
- Tests should be **fast and independent**

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email the maintainers** privately
3. **Provide detailed information** about the vulnerability
4. **Allow reasonable time** for a fix before public disclosure

### Security Best Practices

- **No hardcoded credentials** or API keys
- **Validate all inputs** from users and external sources
- **Use secure defaults** for all configuration options
- **Handle sensitive data** securely (no logging of passwords, tokens, etc.)
- **Follow principle of least privilege**

## üìö Project Phases

VulnScan is developed in 9 phases. Before contributing, familiarize yourself with:

- **Current phase**: See [project-state.md](project-state.md)
- **Phase details**: See [docs/fasi/README.md](docs/fasi/README.md)
- **Technical requirements**: See [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md)

### Contributing to Current Phase

Focus contributions on the **current active phase** to maintain project coherence. If you want to work on future phases, please discuss with maintainers first.
